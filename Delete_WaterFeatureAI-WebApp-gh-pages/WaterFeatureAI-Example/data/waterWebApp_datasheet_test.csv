An object-wise method was proposed to extract the water body of remote sensing image, which is locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator networks (LEGION). This oscillation network could bind an object based on the similar property. The oscillation network in this paper used the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to encode the binding of pixels of water body. Because of the good coherence of spectrum of water body on the remote sensing image, the pixels of the water surface have strong couple weight and can overcome the globally inhibition in the network. Additionally the special spectrum property also was considered, it could reduce the disturber of the other ground object which has the similar spectra property. The proposed method combined both pixel-wise and object-wise scale. Thus, the proposed extraction method was robust to noise, and could keep the detail information of water body. The outputs were according to the human perception mechanism and can be used in the higher image analysis and reorganization. The results of experiment validate the effective of the proposed method.","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3059544719406560473&as_sdt=5,32&sciodt=0,32&hl=en",22,water body,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For different terrain, all the methods rely heavily on carefully hand-engineered feature selection and large amounts of prior knowledge. Due to the difficulty and high cost in acquiring, the labeled data of remote sensing is relatively small. Thus, there exist some challenges in the classification of huge amount of high dimension remote sensing data. Deep Learning has a good capacity of hierarchical feature learning from unlabeled data. Stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE), one deep learning method, is widely investigated for image recognition. In this paper, a new water body extraction model based on SSAE is established. At first, current useful features (NDWI, NDVI, NDBI and so forth) are collected to construct unique feature matrix for each pixel. Next, a Feature Expansion Algorithm (FEA) is designed by taking account of the influence of neighboring pixels to expand feature matrixes. Setting the expansion features as inputs, SSAE is trained to extract water body. The experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) and traditional neural network (NN). Meanwhile, the proposed FEA explored more distinct features of water body so that the accuracy of water body extraction was improved to a great extent.","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5002876971505102146&as_sdt=5,32&sciodt=0,32&hl=en",19,water body,unsupervised feature learning,deep learning,water body extraction,feature expansion algorithm,stacked sparse autoencoders

It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g, rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water/shadow/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used. Both levels employ machine learning for the image interpretation. The proposed framework is validated using the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images, over two mega cities in China, i.e, Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracies for both water extraction [95.4% (Shenzhen), 96.2% (Wuhan)], and water type classification [94.1% (Shenzhen), 95.9% (Wuhan)] in complex urban areas.","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11705250609960253894&as_sdt=5,32&sciodt=0,32&hl=en",63,water body,high resolution,machine learning,object-oriented,water detection,water extraction

Traditional Landsat water indices require carefully selected threshold values that vary depending on the region being imaged and on the atmospheric conditions. They also suffer from many false positives, arising mainly from snow and ice, and from terrain and cloud shadows being mistaken for water. Systems that produce high-quality water maps usually rely on ancillary data and complex rule-based expert systems to overcome these problems.

Index methods are mostly used for surface water estimation which separates the water from the background based on a threshold value. Generally, the threshold is a fixed value, but can be challenging in the case of environmental noise, such as shadow, forest, built-up areas, snow, and clouds. One such challenging scene can be found in Nepal where no such evaluation has been done. Taking that in consideration, this study evaluates the performance of the most widely used water indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) in a Landsat 8 scene of Nepal. The scene, ranging from 60 m to 8848 m, contains various types of water bodies found in Nepal with different forms of environmental noise. The evaluation was conducted based on measures from a confusion matrix derived using validation points. Comparing visually and quantitatively, not a single method was able to extract surface water in the entire scene with better accuracy. Upon selecting optimum thresholds, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kappa) was improved, but not satisfactory. NDVI and NDWI showed better results for only pure water pixels, whereas MNDWI and AWEI were unable to reject snow cover and shadows. Combining NDVI with NDWI and AWEI with shadow improved the accuracy but inherited the NDWI and AWEI characteristics. Segmenting the test scene with elevations above and below 665 m, and using NDVI and NDWI for detecting water, resulted in an OA of 0.9638 and kappa of 0.8979.

First, we preclassify the entire remote sensing image into the water and nonwater areas via Deep U-Net, using the results of class membership probabilities as the unary potential in the CRF model. The pairwise potential of CRF is defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels, which forms a fully connected neighbor structure. Next, regional restriction is incorporated into the approach to enhance the consistency of the connected area. We use the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to generate superpixels and correct the binary classification results by calculating their average posterior probabilities. Finally, a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm, mean-field inference, is generated for the final model. The results from the experimental application to GaoFen-2 images and WorldView-2 images demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits competitive quantitative and qualitative performance, which effectively reduces salt-and-pepper noise and retains the edge structures of water bodies.

In this letter, a new segmentation network called restricted receptive field deconvolution network (RRF DeconvNet) is proposed, with which to extract water bodies from high-resolution remote sensing images. Compared with natural images, remote sensing images have a weaker pixel neighborhood relativity; in consideration of this challenge, an RRF DeconvNet compresses the redundant layers in the original DeconvNet and no longer relies on a pretrained model. In addition, to tackle the blurring boundaries that occur in CNN, a new loss function called edges weighting loss is proposed to train segmentation networks, which has been shown to significantly sharpen the segmentation boundaries in results.

Two different seasonal GaoFen-2 images with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m in the south of the Beijing metropolitan area were used to extensively validate the FCN model. Four key factors including input features, training data, transfer learning, and data augmentation related to the performance of the FCN model were empirically analyzed by using 36 combinations of various parameter settings. Our findings indicate that the FCN-based method can work as a robust and cost-effective tool in the extraction of water bodies from VHR images.

A single-scale training mode will cause one-sided extraction results, which can lead to “reverse” errors and imprecise detail expression. Therefore, fusing multiscale features for pixel-level classification is the key to achieving accurate image segmentation. Based on this concept, this paper proposes a deep learning scheme to achieve fine extraction of image water bodies. The process includes multiscale feature perception splitting of images, a restructured deep learning network model, multiscale joint prediction, and postprocessing optimization performed by a fully connected conditional random field (CRF). According to the scale space concept of remote sensing, we apply hierarchical multiscale splitting processing to images. Then, we improve the structure of the image semantic segmentation model DeepLabV3+, an advanced image semantic segmentation model, and adjust the feature output layer of the model to multiscale features after weighted fusion. At the back end of the deep learning model, the water boundary details are optimized with the fully connected CRF. The proposed multiscale training method is well adapted to feature extraction for the different scale images in the model. In the multiscale output fusion, assigning different weights to the output features of each scale controls the influence of the various scale features on the water extraction results. We carried out a large number of water extraction experiments on GF1 remote sensing images.

Watershed delineation is a process for creating a boundary that represents the contributing area for a specific control point or water outlet, with the intent of characterization and analysis of portions of a study area.

Deep learning for wetland identification is an emerging field that shows promise for advancing these efforts. Deep learning is unique to traditional machine learning techniques for its ability to consider the spatial context of object characteristics within a landscape scene. However, applying deep learning typically requires very large datasets for training the algorithms, which limits their application for many environmental applications including wetland identification. Using four study sites across Virginia with field delineated wetlands, we provide insight into the potential for deep learning for wetland detection from limited, but typical, wetland delineation training data. Our proposed workflow performs a wetland semantic segmentation using DeepNets, a deep learning architecture for remote sensing data, and an input dataset consisting of high-resolution topographic indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Results show that models trained and evaluated for a single site were able to achieve high accuracy (up to 91% recall and 56% precision) and similar accuracy can be obtained for models trained across multiple sites (up to 91% recall and 57% precision). Through this analysis we found that, across all sites, input data configurations taking advantage of hydrologic properties derived from elevation data consistently outperformed models using the elevation data directly, showing the benefit of physically-informed inputs in deep learning training for wetland identification. By refining the wetland identification workflow presented in this paper and collecting additional training data across landscapes, there is potential for deep learning algorithms to support a range wetland conservation efforts.

One problem is that the traditional structure of DSSNs does not consider multiscale and multishape characteristics of water bodies. Another problem is that a large amount of unlabeled data is not fully utilized during the training process, but the unlabeled data often contain meaningful supervision information.

Recently, with the development of optical remote sensing sensors in resolutions and qualities, as well as the convenience in data acquisition, remote sensing images have become an important data source for assisting water body measurements. However, due to the considerable variations of water bodies in shapes, areas, and sizes, the diversities of colour appearances, and the complicated surface and surrounding scenarios, it is still challenging to automatically and accurately extract water bodies from remote sensing images. In this paper, we develop a novel self-attention capsule feature pyramid network (SA-CapsFPN) to extract water bodies from remote sensing images.

The FYOLOv3 mainly includes three parts: an improved object detection network based on YOLOv3 (Seattle, WA, USA), a fully convolutional network (FCN) without pooling layers, and a similarity algorithm for water extraction. The improved object detection network uses 13 convolutional layers instead of Darknet-53 as the model backbone network, which guarantees the water detection accuracy while reducing the time cost and alleviating the overfitting phenomenon; secondly, the FCN without pooling layers is proposed to obtain the accurate pixel value of the tidal flat waterbody by learning the semantic information; finally, a similarity algorithm for water extraction is proposed to distinguish the waterbody from non-water pixel by pixel to improve the extraction accuracy of tidal flat water bodies.

In this network, each layer of the network can receive the feature maps of all layers before it by the densely connected module of DenseNet. The concatenate operation on the feature dimension is used when connecting across layers. It can realize the different levels of features reuse. The local-feature-compression module is introduced before concatenate operation. It can obtain the more abstract features further by the convolution operation.

Currently, researchers have attempted to use neural networks to extract water from remote sensing images. However, most of these studies used computer vision techniques to improve the model results without considering the multi-band information unique to remote sensing images. Thus our study proposes an improved DeepLabv3+ network to increase the water body extraction accuracy in urban remote sensing images. The DeepLabv3+ network has the characteristics of extracting image features at multiple scales. We improved the network structure to incorporate multi-band features. By comparing several multi-band input methods, the feature map calculated by the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was converted into an input suitable for the neural network by comparing several multi-band input methods. Simultaneously, we developed a parallel convolution structure to combine the NDWI feature map with a standard false color remote sensing image during feature extraction. This allows the network to focus more on image areas that may be water bodies. We used atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2A L2A-level data, divided the training set at multiple scales, and conducted several experiments. The results show that the proposed network can improve water extraction accuracy when training subregions are unified from different sizes to 512 × 512. Finally, we used the model to extract water bodies from remote sensing images from different regions. We combined the images with visual interpretation to verify the reliability of the model results.

A fundamental solution to this problem is still lacking, thus, the best option for counteracting the effects of algal blooms is to improve advance warnings (predictions). However, existing physical prediction models have difficulties setting a clear coefficient indicating the relationship between each factor when predicting algal blooms, and many variable data sources are required for the analysis. These limitations are accompanied by high time and economic costs. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and deep learning methods have become increasingly common in scientific research; attempts to apply the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to environmental research problems are increasing because the LSTM model exhibits good performance for time-series data prediction. However, few studies have applied deep learning models or LSTM to algal bloom prediction, especially in South Korea, where algal blooms occur annually. Therefore, we employed the LSTM model for algal bloom prediction in four major rivers of South Korea. We conducted short-term (one week) predictions by employing regression analysis and deep learning techniques on a newly constructed water quality and quantity dataset drawn from 16 dammed pools on the rivers. Three deep learning models (multilayer perceptron, MLP; recurrent neural network, RNN; and long short-term memory, LSTM) were used to predict chlorophyll-a, a recognized proxy for algal activity. The results were compared to those from OLS (ordinary least square) regression analysis and actual data based on the root mean square error (RSME). The LSTM model showed the highest prediction rate for harmful algal blooms and all deep learning models out-performed the OLS regression analysis.

To address the problems, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with hierarchical structure was designed to represent the relationship between Landsat8 images and in situ water-quality levels. A transfer-learning strategy in the CNN model was introduced to deal with the lack of in situ measurement data. After the CNN model was trained by spatially and temporally matched Landsat8 images and in situ water-quality data that were collected from official websites, the surface quality of the whole water body could be classified. We tested the CNN model at the Erhai and Chaohu lakes in China, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate that the CNN model outperformed widely used machine-learning methods.

of Hong Kong. Concentrations of suspended solids (SS), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and turbidity were estimated with several machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
Random Forest (RF), Cubist regression (CB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Landsat (5,7,8) reflectance data were compared with in situ reflectance data to evaluate the performance of machine
learning models. The highest accuracies of the water quality indicators were achieved by ANN for both, in situ reflectance data (89%-Chl-a, 93%-SS, and 82%-turbidity) and satellite data (91%-Chl-a,
92%-SS, and 85%-turbidity. The water quality parameters retrieved by the ANN model was further compared to those retrieved by “standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour” (C2RCC) processing
chain model C2RCC-Nets. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) for estimating SS and Chl-a were 3.3 mg/L and 2.7 µg/L, respectively, using ANN, whereas RMSEs were 12.7 mg/L and 12.9 µg/L
for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and Chl-a concentrations, respectively, when C2RCC was applied on Landsat-8 data. Relative variable importance was also conducted to investigate the
consistency between in situ reflectance data and satellite data, and results show that both datasets are similar. The red band (wavelength ≈ 0.665 µm) and the product of red and green band (wavelength ≈ 0.560 µm) were influential inputs in both reflectance data sets for estimating SS and turbidity, and the ratio between red and blue band (wavelength ≈ 0.490 µm) as well as the ratio between infrared (wavelength ≈ 0.865 µm) and blue band and green band proved to be more useful for the estimation of Chl-a concentration, due to their sensitivity to high turbidity in the coastal

In addition, an improved strategy based on correlation analysis method is presented for evidence theory to obtain the number of evidence, which reduces uncertainty in evidence selection effectively. Besides, a new basic probability assignment function which based on modified softmax function is proposed. The new function can effectively solve the problems of weight allocation failure in the traditional function. Then, data about permanganate index, pH, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen from Jiuxishuichang monitoring station near Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China is used to verify the proposed model. Compared with support vector regression (SVR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and three RNN models, the new model shows higher accuracy and better stability as indicated by four indices. Finally, the engineering application of the RNNs-DS algorithm has been realized on the self-developed water environmental monitoring and forecasting system, which can provide effective support for early risk assessment and prevention in water environment.","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1402179651252163686&as_sdt=5,32&sciodt=0,32&hl=en",36,water quality,recurrent neural network,evidence theory,water quality prediction,temporal correlation analysis,multiscale predictions

Modelling Lake water quality, utilizing the data obtained from the in-situ measurements, collecting samples from the in situ and analyzing them in a laboratory are very expensive and time consuming. Several algorithms can be used to model lake water quality using the in-situ measurements data. In this work, Deep Learning was used to perform pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and turbidity modelling of the Itasy Lake. Deep Learning is another branch of machine learning or automatic training that works well to solve many problems. The obtained results demonstrated that the developed model of a deep neural network (deep learning) provides an excellent relationship between the observed and simulated water quality parameters. Moreover, the coefficient of correlation (R2) was 0.89 for pH, 0.97 for the dissolved oxygen, 0.96 for the conductivity and 0.99 for the turbidity. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and turbidity were below 0.22, 0.21 mg.l-1, 1.37 µS.cm-1, and 0.53 NTU respectively, during the deep learning training and validation phases. After getting the model, the parameters of the Itasy Lake water were estimated on 1st January 2019. The obtained results are as follows: pH was ranged from 7.1 to 7.6, 7.0 mg.l-1 to 7.2 mg.l-1 for the dissolved oxygen, 55.7 µS.cm-1 to 57.1 µS.cm-1 for the conductivity and 12.0 to 12.2 NTU for the turbidity. It was shown that the water quality of Itasy respects the Malagasy norm with regard to pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and turbidity.

Traditional monitoring techniques, although highly accurate, are vastly insufficient in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. Using a virtual constellation by harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data a high temporal frequency dataset can be created at a relatively fine spatial scale. In this study, we apply a novel deep learning method for the estimation of blue-green algae (BGA), chlorophyll-α (Chl), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance (SC), and turbidity. The developed model is evaluated against previously studied machine learning methods and found to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and extreme learning machine regression (ELR) generating R2 of 0.91 for BGA, 0.88, 0.89, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.84 for Chl, DO, SC, and turbidity respectfully. This model is then applied to all available data ranging from 2013–2018 and time series for each variable were generated for four selected waterbodies. We then use the Empirical Data Analytics (EDA) anomaly detection method on the time series to identify abnormal data points. Upon further analysis, the EDA method successfully identifies abnormal events in water quality. Our results also demonstrate strong correlation between non-optically active variables such as SC with Chl and fDOM.

Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 μg P L−1, 22.7 μg P L−1, and 20.7 μg P L−1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 μg P L−1, 10.9 μg P L−1, and 10.7 μg P L−1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 μg P L−1 and 28.0 μg P L−1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model.

Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, specifically pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (C), electrical conductivity (EC; lS/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t - 1) and two (t - 2) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively. Each model’s performance in both training and testing phases was assessed using statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents (RRMSE, RMAE; %), percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (ENS), Willmott’s Index, and graphical plots (Taylor diagram, box plot and spider diagram). Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN–LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a.

The monitoring of surface water quality by remote sensing monitoring technology can provide important research significance for water resources protection and water quality evaluation. Finding the optimal spectral index sensitive to water quality for remote sensing monitoring of water quality is extremely important for surface water quality analysis and treatment in the Ebinur Lake Basin in arid areas. This study used Sentinel-2MSI data at 10 m resolution to quickly monitor the water quality of the watershed. Through laboratory experiments and measurement data from the Ebinur Lake Basin, 22 water quality parameters (WQPs) were obtained. Through Z-score and redundancy analysis, 9 WQPs with significant contributions were extracted. Based on the remote sensing spectral band, four water indexes (NDWI, NWI, EWI, AWEI-nsh) and 2D modeling spectral index (DI, RI, NDI), the correlation analysis between WQPs and two kinds of spectral band indexes is carried out, and it is concluded that the overall correlation between WQP and 2D spectral modeling is more relevant. This paper calculates the evaluation and models the 2D spectrum of the Water Quality Index (WQI). The WQI is predicted and modeled through four machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, PLSR, PLSR-SVM).The results show that the inversion effect of the two-dimensional spectral modeling index on water quality parameters (WQPs) is superior to that of the water index, and the correlation coefficient of the DI (R12-R1) SWIR-2 and BLUE band interpolation index reaches 0.787. On this basis, three kinds of two-dimensional spectral modeling indexes are used to inversely synthesize the WQI, and the correlation coefficient of the ratio index of the RI (R11/R8) SWIR-1 and near-infrared (NIR) bands is preferably 0.69. In the WQI prediction, the partial least squares regression support vector machine (PLSR-SVM) model in machine learning algorithms has good modeling and prediction effects (R2 c ¼ 0.873, R2 v ¼ 0.87), which can provide a good basis.

monitoring water quality programs, especially in developing countries. Moreover, usage of remote
sensing approaches has not been broadly applied in monitoring routines. Therefore, it is necessary to
assess the efficacy of available sensors to complement the often limited field measurements from such
programs and build models that support monitoring tasks. Here, we integrate field measurements
(2013–2019) from the Mexican national water quality monitoring system (RNMCA) with data from
Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, and Sentinel-2 MSI to train an extreme learning machine (ELM), a
support vector regression (SVR) and a linear regression (LR) for estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),
Turbidity, Total Suspended Matter (TSM) and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD). Additionally, OLCI Level-2
Products for Chl-a and TSM are compared against the RNMCA data. We observed that OLCI Level-2
Products are poorly correlated with the RNMCA data and it is not feasible to rely only on them to
support monitoring operations. However, OLCI atmospherically corrected data is useful to develop
accurate models using an ELM, particularly for Turbidity (R2 = 0.7). We conclude that remote sensing
is useful to support monitoring systems tasks, and its progressive integration will improve the quality
of water quality monitoring programs.",NA,NA,water quality,Landsat 8 OLI,Sentinel 2 MSI,Sentinel 3 OLCI,water quality monitoring system,extreme machine learning

This study aims to address this limitation through the development of a novel synthetic dataset of top-of-atmosphere and bottom-of-atmosphere reflectances, which is the first to encompass the immense natural optical variability present in inland waters. Novel aspects of the synthetic dataset include: 1) physics-based, two-layered, size- and type-specific phytoplankton inherent optical properties (IOPs) for mixed eukaryotic/cyanobacteria assemblages; 2) calculations of mixed assemblage chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fluorescence; 3) modeled phycocyanin concentration derived from assemblage-based phycocyanin absorption; 4) and paired sensor-specific top-of-atmosphere reflectances, including optically extreme cases and the contribution of green vegetation adjacency. The synthetic bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra were compiled into 13 distinct optical water types similar to those discovered using in-situ data. Inspection showed similar relationships of concentrations and IOPs to those of natural waters. This dataset was used to calculate typical surviving water-leaving signal at top-of-atmosphere, and used to train and test four state-of-the-art machine learning architectures for multi-parameter retrieval and cross-sensor capability. Initial results provide reliable estimates of water quality parameters and IOPs over a highly dynamic range of water types, at various spectral and spatial sensor resolutions. The results of this work represent a significant leap forward in our capacity for routine, global monitoring of inland water quality.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=17678600173564172649&as_sdt=5,2,water quality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Poor water quality has an impact not just on aquatic life but also on the ecosystem. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to estimate water quality parameters with satellite data. The data was gathered using the Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE citation databases. Related articles were extracted, selected, and evaluated using advanced keyword search and the PRISMA approach. The bibliographic information from publications written in journals during the previous two decades were collected. Publications that applied ML to water quality parameter retrieval with a focus on the application of satellite data were identified for further systematic review. A search query of 1796 papers identified 113 eligible studies. Popular ML models application were artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), regression, cubist, genetic programming (GP) and decision tree (DT). Common water quality parameters extracted were chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), temperature, salinity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended solids and turbidity. According to the systematic analysis, ML can be successfully extended to water quality monitoring, allowing researchers to forecast and learn from natural processes in the environment, as well as assess human impacts on an ecosystem. These efforts will also help with restoration programs to ensure that environmental policy guidelines are followed.",NA,NA,water quality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, water quality monitoring in inland waters by satellite remote sensing remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and instrumental resolution limitations. We propose the concept of proximal remote sensing for monitoring water quality. The proximal hyperspectral imager, developed by Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Hikvision Digital Technology, Ltd., is a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution (1 nm) sensor for continuous observation, allowing for effective and practical long-term monitoring of inland water quality. In this study, machine learning and empirical algorithms were developed and validated using in situ total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and spectral reflectance from Lake Taihu (N = 171), the Liangxi River (N = 94) and the Fuchunjiang Reservoir (N = 109) covering different water quality. Our dataset includes a large range for three key water quality parameters of TN from 0.93 to 6.46 mg/L, TP from 0.04 to 0.62 mg/L, and COD from 1.32 to 15.41 mg/L. Overall, the back-propagation (BP) neural network model had an accuracy of over 80% for TN (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.33 mg/L, and MRE = 11.4%) and over 90% for TP (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.02 mg/L, and MRE = 12.4%) and COD (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.66 mg/L, and MRE = 9.3%). Our results show that proximal remote sensing combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential for monitoring water quality in inland waters.",NA,NA,water quality,proximal remote sensing,water quality,machine learning algorithms,BP neural networks,empirical algorithms
